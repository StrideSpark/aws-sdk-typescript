    /**
     * Adds one or more tags to an ACM Certificate. Tags are labels that you can use to
identify and organize your AWS resources. Each tag consists of a key and an
optional value. You specify the certificate on input by its Amazon Resource Name
(ARN). You specify the tag by using a key-value pair.

You can apply a tag to just one certificate if you want to identify a specific
characteristic of that certificate, or you can apply the same tag to multiple
certificates if you want to filter for a common relationship among those
certificates. Similarly, you can apply the same tag to multiple resources if you
want to specify a relationship among those resources. For example, you can add
the same tag to an ACM Certificate and an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer
to indicate that they are both used by the same website. For more information,
see Tagging ACM Certificates
[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/tags.html].

To remove one or more tags, use the RemoveTagsFromCertificate action. To view
all of the tags that have been applied to the certificate, use the 
ListTagsForCertificate action.

     * Imports an SSL/TLS certificate into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to use with

ACM does not provide managed renewal
[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-renewal.html] for
certificates that you import.

For more information about importing certificates into ACM, including the
differences between certificates that you import and those that ACM provides,
see Importing Certificates
[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/import-certificate.html] in the 
AWS Certificate Manager User Guide.

To import a certificate, you must provide the certificate and the matching
private key. When the certificate is not self-signed, you must also provide a
certificate chain. You can omit the certificate chain when importing a
self-signed certificate.

The certificate, private key, and certificate chain must be PEM-encoded. For
more information about converting these items to PEM format, see Importing
Certificates Troubleshooting
[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/import-certificate.html#import-certificate-troubleshooting] 
in the AWS Certificate Manager User Guide.

To import a new certificate, omit the CertificateArn field. Include this field
only when you want to replace a previously imported certificate.

This operation returns the Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html] of
the imported certificate.

top-level domains you specified in the certificate request.

The ARN must be of the form:

 
arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:123456789012:certificate/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 **/
      CertificateArn: Arn;
      /** The Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the certificate that needs to be
validated. **/
      Domain: DomainNameString;
      /** The base validation domain that will act as the suffix of the email addresses
that are used to send the emails. This must be the same as the Domain value or a
superdomain of the Domain value. For example, if you requested a certificate for 
site.subdomain.example.com and specify a ValidationDomain of 
subdomain.example.com, ACM sends email to the domain registrant, technical
contact, and administrative contact in WHOIS and the following five addresses:

&amp;#42;  admin@subdomain.example.com
 
 
*  administrator@subdomain.example.com
 
 
*  hostmaster@subdomain.example.com
 
 
*  postmaster@subdomain.example.com
 
 
*  webmaster@subdomain.example.com **/
